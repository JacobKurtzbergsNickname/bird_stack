# Bird Stack

Honest to Murgatroid (Oh god, where did that come from?), I just wanted to try a couple of things:

1. I wanted to try Robyn (I don't know Rust or PyO3 yet, but it sounded cool)
2. I thought to use Fauna with it, because then I could call it a Bird Stack, which amuses me
3. I wanted to know, and this is the main thing: How do I deploy multi-technology stacks on Netlify?

So, here I am, building a basic app within those parameters. ðŸ™‚
